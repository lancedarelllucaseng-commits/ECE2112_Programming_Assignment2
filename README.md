CONTENTS OF THIS ASSIGNMENT:

NORMALIZATION PROBLEM: 
Normalization is one of the most basic preprocessing techniques in data analytics. This involves centering and scaling process. Centering means subtracting the data from the mean and scaling means dividing with its standard deviation. Mathematically, normalization can be expressed as:  
ùëç=ùëã‚àíùë• ùúé  
In Python, element-wise mean and element-wise standard deviation can be obtained by using .mean() and .std() calls.   
In this problem, create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X. Save your normalized ndarray as X_normalized.npy 

DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM: 
Create the following 10 x 10 ndarray. Which are the squares of the first 100 positive integers. From this ndarray, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3. Save the result as div_by_3.npy 

NOTES: 
In order to accomplish this Programming Assignment I had to access notes that were coded from the computer lab last week, needed help from some of my classmates since I was late to class last week 
and weren't able to code other examples that were included in the lesson. Also online references such as videos and extra information from google.
